**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Re-learned some numpy and pandas commands, watched some math videos and did a project on finding area of circle using derivative graph method.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while since I last coded some python due to exams and stuff so had to re-learn some stuffs to not hinder my progress in the future.
