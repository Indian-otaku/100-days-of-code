### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: November 13, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Re-learned some numpy and pandas commands, watched some math videos and did a project on finding area of circle using derivative graph method.

**Thoughts:** Its been a while since I last coded some python due to exams and stuff so had to re-learn some stuffs to not hinder my progress in the future.

**Link to work:** [Area of circle](https://twitter.com/An_Indian_Otaku/status/1459520327042564098?s=20) [source code](https://github.com/Indian-otaku/Miscellaneous_python_programs/tree/main/Area_of_circle)

### Day 2: November 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Finished a Udemy video on linear regression and classification, gradient descent, learnt some R syntaxes, finished chapter 1 of An introduction to statistical learning. 

**Thoughts:** Its been a while since I last learned R and machine learning. Gotta make up fast for the days I wasted on learning for sem 2 exam.

**Link to work:** This site was very useful for learning [Gradient Descent](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2017/04/simple-understand-gradient-descent-algorithm.html)


### Day 3: November 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Read book, some sites on linear regression and commited a file on linear regression.

**Thoughts:** College started and overall coding part decreased to like nil for today but did finally started the learning streak of college cs topics and machine learning. College classes going well for today.

**Link to work:** Made this today [Linear regression](https://github.com/Indian-otaku/Machine_learning_models_explained/blob/main/Linear_regression.md) in github and also [twitter](https://twitter.com/An_Indian_Otaku/status/1460254439818743808?s=20)


### Day 4: November 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* *Self learn:* Read book, did linear regression problems, referred some ml topics, discrete maths.
* *College:* Java started, discrete maths.

**Thoughts:** Finally started Java in college today, was more easier than I initially thought it'll be. Discrete maths is unlike the maths i know from general engineering maths and damn its easy. Didnt progress much in ml today but changed my approach from bottom up to top down. Thats because I temporarily saw my growth rate declining, also people generally prefer top down because its easy to deal with. Probably might start Kaggling from tomorrow onwards.

**Link to work:** Found this [site](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) for learning ml today. 

### Day 5: November 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* *Self learn:* Started Kaggle course.
* *College:* Logic system design started, did some C programs.

**Thoughts:** Didnt progress much today but np atleast it wasnt a total rest. Visited college library for the first time and found some great books about deep learning, but didnt find any about machine learning. Ah well np I intend on buying one for myself so yeah np...

**Link to work:** No link today 

### Day 6: November 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: 
* *Self learn:* Finished Titanic project in Kaggle course.
* *College:* Explored the library thats all but totally worth it.

**Thoughts:** Damn I still remember the last time around 4 months ago when I couldnt understand the definitons in kaggle but now ended up doing a competition. progress was slow but there's surely progress.
